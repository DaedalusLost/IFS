/******************************************************/
Technology used is Nodejs, Express, Common Express middleware, angular, bootstrap and mysql/cassandra.

/******************************************************/

Run the application 
npm start 

Run the application for development
npm test

these are scripts declared in package.json

/******************************************************/

If you need to install a library or package make sure to save it in the package.json

For Deployment and development
npm install packageName --save 

For Development only
 npm install packageName --save-dev

We shouldn't have to many global package installs but if needed
npm install -g nodemon -> globally installs nodemon

-> Nodemon is a development tool to monitor the application and automaticallly apply most changes
